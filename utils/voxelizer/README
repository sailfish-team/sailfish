A simple program to voxelize STL files into numpy boolean arrays that can
be loaded in Sailfish.  You will need the Common Versatile Multi-purpose
Library for C++ in order to compile this program.  You can download it from:

Once you get the archive, unpack it so that the library is in the cvmlcpp
directory.
