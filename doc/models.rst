Supported models, grids and boundary conditions
===============================================

The Sailfish solver currently supports the following Lattice-Boltzmann models and grids:

* single fluid

  * two-dimensional: D2Q9 (BGK, MRT models)
  * three-dimensional: D3Q13 (MRT), D3Q15, D3Q19 (BGK, MRT models)

* binary fluid

  * two-dimensional: Shan-Chen (D2Q9), free-energy (D2Q9, BGK, MRT) [PRE78]_
  * three-dimensional: Shan-Chen, free-energy (D3Q19, BGK, MRT)

.. [PRE78] Contact line dynamics in binary lattice Boltzmann simulations, Phys. Rev. E 78, 056709 (2008). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.78.056709

The single fluid models are implemented in both the incompressible and weakly compressible version, the
latter of which is the default.  To turn on the incompressible model, use the ``--incompressible``
command line switch.

An external force field (body force) can be enabled in all models.

A general overview of the Lattice-Boltzmann method
--------------------------------------------------

The Lattice-Boltzmann method is based on solving the following equation:

.. math:: f_\alpha(\vec{x_i} + \vec{e_\alpha}, t + 1) - f_\alpha(\vec{x_i}, t) = \Omega_i

which is a discrete version of the Boltzmann equation known from non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics.  Here, :math:`f_\alpha` are distributions of particles
moving in the direction :math:`\vec{e_\alpha}` (the available directions are specified
by the chosen grid), :math:`t` is the current time step, :math:`\vec{x_i}` is the
position of the :math:`i`-th node in the grid, and :math:`\Omega_i` is the collision
operator.

TODO: Add more info about the LBM.

Single relaxation time (BGK)
----------------------------

The BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) approximation is based on the following form
of the collision operator:

.. math:: \Omega_i = -\frac{f(\vec{x_i}, t) - f^{(eq)}(\rho_i, \vec{v_i})}{\tau}

where :math:`\tau` is the relaxation time and :math:`f^{(eq)}` is the equilibrium
distribution, defined as a function of macroscopic variables at a node.

TODO: Add more info about the BGK approximation and its limitations.

Multiple relaxation times (MRT)
-------------------------------

TODO: Add info about the MRT model.

Boundary conditions
-------------------

Sailfish supports a number of local boundary conditions (non-local boundary conditions are
currently not supported).  Check the :mod:`node_type` module for a full and up-to-date list.

Full-way bounce-back
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the simplest type of boundary condition, available for no-slip and velocity nodes in
all dimensions.  The boundary condition imposed by the full-way bounce-back algorithm takes
effect in the middle between the boundary node (which is a dry node, i.e. it does not
represent any fluid volume and does not undergo collisions) and the neighboring fluid node.
The algorithm does not require any knowledge about the normal vector of the
wall, so it can work in arbitrarily complex geometries.

Full-way bounce-back works as follows:

* at time :math:`t` distributions are propagated from the fluid to the bounce-back node
* at time :math:`t+1` the distributions at the bounce-back node are reflected across the
  node center, and then streamed in the standard way

This can be summarized as :math:`f_{i}^{pre}(x, t+2) = f_{opp(i)}^{post}(x, t)` since it
takes two time steps for the reflected distributions to reach back the fluid nodes.

Half-way bounce-back
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The half-way bounce-back boundary rule is based on a similar idea as the full-way bounce-back.
Here however, the reflection takes only one time step and takes place exactly in
the middle between the fluid node and what would be the first node outside of the simulation domain:
:math:`f_{i}^{pre}(x, t+1) = f_{opp(i)}^{post}(x, t)`.  The half-way bounce-back nodes are
wet (i.e. true fluid nodes undergoing a standard collision process).

For non-stationary flows the half-way bounce-back rule is more accurate than the full-way
bounce-back.  For stationary flows there is no difference between them as the one step time
lag in the full-way bounce-back rule does not impact the amount of momentum and mass
transferred between the fluid and the boundary.

The wall normal vector is necessary for the half-way bounce-back rule to work as only the
unknown distributions (those for which there is no data streaming from other nodes)
at the boundary nodes are replaced.

Equilibrium
^^^^^^^^^^^
This boundary condition algorithm works by imposing the BGK equilibrium distributions for
a node, and can be used to set the velocity or density of a node.

Zou-He
^^^^^^
This algorithm is based upon the idea of the reflection of the off-equilibrium distributions,
and can be used to set the velocity or density of a node.
