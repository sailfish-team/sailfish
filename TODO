* TASKS

- Automated LDC regtest.
  Add a new regtest to automatically run the Lid-Driven Cavity example,
  and generate plots comparing the results to data from the literature
  (see also regtest/ldc_golden).

- Use the Poiseuille geometry to test velocity BCs.
  By transforming the standard force-driven test case into a moving
  frame of reference, the test case can be redefined so that wall
  nodes are replaced by velocity boundary conditions.  Implement this
  for the 2D and 3D test cases and add this to the Poiseuille regtest.

- Add a Taylor-Green testcase.
  See e.g. the D3Q13 PRE paper for more info about this test case.

- Implement grid refinement.
  Make it possible to define regions of the simulation domain which are
  to be simulated at a higher spatial and temporal resolution.

- Add support for heat transfer calculation.

- Add support for the free energy binary liquid model with D3Q15.
